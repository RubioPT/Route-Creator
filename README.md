Desktop: Right-click on any marker to delete it.

Mobile/Touchscreens: Long-press (hold down) on a marker for about 0.3 seconds to delete it.

Compact User Interface: The Route Management and Route Information panels are consolidated side-by-side, maximizing the map viewing area while maintaining full functionality.

Live Route Information: The interface displays the Total Distance and Point Count for the currently selected route in real-time.

Theme Support: Supports one-click Dark/Light Theme toggling.
